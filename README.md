# Hello Live Reload

A simple easy to follow code sample for making use of [gulp-livereload](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-livereload/) for web development. [Live Reload](http://livereload.com/) allows you to edit and save files causing an automatic page refresh (no refreshing for CSS and images!)

## Prerequisites
* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) if you haven't already
* Node comes with npm (node package manager) installed, so you're good on that front
* Open up your command line and change directory into your desired folder, then type:
    * git clone https://github.com/JamesMilnerUK/hello-live-reload
    * npm install


## Once You're Setup

1. Open up your command line again, type 'gulp' and hit enter,
3. The server should now be running.
3. Go to localhost:8080 in your web browser of choice.
4. Edit index.html in your text editor of choice.
5. Bang! Live Reload!
